<p>This is a music game that uses Cocos Studio for game data processing and user interface design. The game uses C++ programming. </p>
<p>When enter the game interface, you can choose the difficulty and songs. After that, click on the keyboard with your finger according to the rhythm of the music. According to the corresponding time is divided into three levels (perfect, good, miss)  and the corresponding score.</p>
<p>This is a very popular game in China two years ago. Developed by Tencent, I was absolutely a fan of this game. In order to play it even eat four hours in the restaurant (three and a half hours to play this game), but after the completion of this demo, I never touched this game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A simple assignment written by me ^ ^<br>Here is a brief literature review of artificial intelligence and robotics, especially for application of reinforcement learning algorithms. </p>
<p>This paper reports the state-of-the-art on artificial intelligence and robotics in an integrated, concise, and elegantly distilled manner to show the experiences in the field. In particular, this paper provides a broad review of recent developments within the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and AIâ€™s applications for robot. By studying 31 related papers, it concludes that general robot intelligence has experienced tremendous development in recent years, especially in the field of machine learning. However, in terms of autonomous underwater robots and bio-inspired robots, there is almost no consensus nor formalism in the field.</p>
